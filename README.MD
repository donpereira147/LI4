Computer Labs 4 

Key words: DAO, SQL Server, C#
The code represented on here refers to a series of objects that fetch information out of a SQL Server database. 
This code, made entirely by me and (very likely) present somewhere on another person's github, was the only piece that functioned 
on the project that consisted of a mobile application that should suggest a restaurant through likes and dislikes of the costumers.
A desktop application was made on Microsoft Forms, but it was very poor and has no place here.
